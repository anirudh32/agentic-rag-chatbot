If one device fails, the entire circuit is broken and the other devices stop working. \nParallel Circuit: In a parallel circuit, devices are connected side by side, creating multiple paths for \ncurrent. Each device is connected across the power source, so if one fails, the others continue to \noperate—commonly used in house wiring. \nHouse wiring uses multi-strand copper wires insulated with PVC. \nEarthing (Grounding): Connecting electrical equipment to the Earth via a low-resistance wire to protect \nhumans from electric shocks. \nTypes of Circuits: There are 3 types of circuits. They are – \nOpen circuit: If the switch used in the circuit is in “OFF” position, then the circuit is said to be an Open \ncircuit. There will not be any flow of current in an Open circuit. \nClosed circuit: If the switch used in the circuit is in “ON” position, then the circuit is said to be a Closed', 'circuit. There will not be any flow of current in an Open circuit. \nClosed circuit: If the switch used in the circuit is in “ON” position, then the circuit is said to be a Closed \ncircuit. There will be normal flow of current in a Closed circuit. \nShort circuit: When the positive terminal and negative terminal of any circuit comes in contact and at \nthe same time, a very high current flows through the circuit; then it is called as Short circuit. \nWires and Wire Sizes: \nAn electric wire is an insulated conductor made of one or more strands, with insulation of VIR or PVC. \nWire size is given by diameter using Standard Wire Gauge (SWG) and indicates current capacity. \nSpecifications include the number of strands and their gauge—for example, Silk wire 14/36 has 14 \nstrands of 36 SWG each, and 3/18 PVC has 3 strands of 18 SWG each. \nParts of a cable: 1.
